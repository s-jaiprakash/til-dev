# TIL - April 3, 2025

## [11:45] Committed to API Change & Deployment (ETA: 1 hr 15 mins)

## [12:00] VDI Login Time  
- Took **15 minutes** to log in.  

## [12:05] Azure DevOps Repo Authentication Error  
- A previously working Azure DevOps repo started throwing an authentication error.  

## [12:22] Git Authentication Issue Resolved  
- Fixed by generating new credentials on Azure DevOps and running the following command:  

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YourUsername:YourPassword@github.com/YourUsername/YourRepo.git
```

## [12:23] Started Working on API Changes  
- Created a new **API endpoint supporting POST requests**.  
  - WebSocket already exists, but this is needed for **text editor add-in integration**.  
- **[12:35]** API changes completed and tested locally. âœ…  

## [12:35] Deploying Code on Azure ACR  
- Encountered **access denied error** for my VDI IP address.  
- Already have **15 IP addresses whitelisted**, yet it throws an error from a different IP.  
  - Suspect **40.78.*.* should be added**, though not a best practice. Need to check the proper way.  
  - **Resolved** by adding `40.78.196.0/24`. Deployment worked, but the exact reason is unclear.  
- **[12:50]** Successfully deployed and exposed to **Gramener laptops**. ðŸš€
